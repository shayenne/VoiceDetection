# VoiceDetection

This repository contains code related to Singing Voice Detection using VGGish embeddings. 

The dataset used can be found in [MedleyDB](https://medleydb.weebly.com/).

You can see how the common approach example was implemented looking into 'Classification.ipynb' 

If you want to see how the Transfer Learning approach, look into the 'Classification with VGGish.ipynb'

We used the [audioset](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset) to extract the embeddings features. The configuration 
files are inside the dir 'audioset' at this repository.
